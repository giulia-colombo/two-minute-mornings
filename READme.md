# Two Minute Mornings

Inspired by Neil Pasricha's transformative practice, this app provides daily journaling prompts to cultivate gratitude, focus, and a positive mindset. Reflect for just two minutes each morning and experience the power of mindful journaling.

## How to use this app

Two Minute Mornings is designed to integrate seamlessly into your daily routine. Each day, you'll receive three simple prompts:

- Today I will focus on...
- Today I am grateful for...
- Today I will let go of...

These prompts are brief but impactful, allowing you to maintain this positive practice even on your busiest days. There's no minimum text requirement â€“ the key is regular engagement to foster mindfulness and self-improvement.
